Gig Selector - Find Events/Gigs online
-------------
>"Keep Sydney Open"

'Gig Locatr' is a platform for individuals to easily find house music events around Sydney. Since Sydneys lockout laws it has become increasingly difficult to view what's happening in and around the city. This project aims to simplify access to events and artists and promote Sydney's nightlife in a bid to revive it.
